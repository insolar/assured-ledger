// PlayerSM is an example of state machine to illustrate some basic patterns of use.
// PlayerSM looks for a 2nd player, then chooses a game (strategy pattern) and plays the game.
//
// This SM utilizes:
// - shared data + publish to connect players into pairs
// - sync object to handle limited capacity of rooms (PlayRoomLimiter), a pair of players require a room.
// - async adapter call to get a game to play
// - barge-in to wake up players
// - subroutine SM to actually play the game as PlayerSM's code knows no games
